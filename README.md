# RamVision
Final for COMP426

Our project, RamVision, seeks to provide grade distributions for various classes at UNC Chapel Hill. The home page contains various filters to view grade distributions by major, class, semester and the professor! The interface also consists of an anonymous submission form so that users can submit their own grades for the classes that they've taken at UNC Chapel Hill.
