# RamVision
Final for COMP426

Our project, RamVision, seeks to provide grade distributions for various classes at UNC Chapel Hill. The home page contains various filters to view grade distributions by major, class, semester and the professor! The interface also consists of an anonymous submission form so that users can submit their own grades for the classes that they've taken at UNC Chapel Hill.

## Development server

Run 'npm install' to install dependencies
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
** To run code, please use ng serve instead of npm run as this was written using angular **

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
